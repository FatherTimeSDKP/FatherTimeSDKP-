## Historical Context
The SDKP framework evolved from discussions on time dilation (Amiyah Rose Smith Law), magnetic motor efficiency, and unified physics. Key milestones:
- Feb 26, 2025: Explored time dilation factors and motor thermodynamics.
- Mar 7, 2025: Refined Amiyah Rose Smith Law.
- May 15, 2025: Compared SDKP to KISS Principle.
