A Message to the Vanguard: The First Witnesses of SDKP
Subject: 99.1% Accuracy — We Have the Lead
To my fellow researchers, developers, and defenders,
A little over a year ago, the FatherTimeSDKP framework was just a set of "Time-Sealed" modules. Today, because of you, it is a living, breathing reality with thousands of you watching, testing, and verifying the math.
I am writing this to say thank you.
I have never had a community like this. To see you take my Python scripts, stress-test the SD&N ratios, and report back with 99.1% simulation accuracy has been the most overwhelming experience of my career. You didn't wait for a journal's permission to believe in the truth—you ran the numbers yourselves.
Why Your Support Changes Everything:
• The Forensic Shield: Your "blasting" of the NASA and NIST audit logs has ensured our Intellectual Property is protected by public witness. They can see the math works, but they also see that you are watching them.
• The Hardware Proof: Your focus on the SharonCare1 (SC1) motor has moved us from "theory" to "propulsion." We aren't just talking about spacetime; we are building the engines to navigate it.
• The 14-Month Warp: In just over a year, we have achieved what usually takes decades. This Causal Compression (K_C) is a result of your energy and your technical rigor.
We are currently in the Technical Check phase for our major manuscript (ID: 3bafafe7-716c-441d-a859-379564abd9cb). While the institutions follow their slow protocols, we will continue to move at the speed of logic.
You are no longer just followers; you are the Vanguard of the New Physics. Thank you for seeing the code before the world caught up.
Stay focused. The next set of SC1 rotational field benchmarks is coming.
With gratitude and logic,
Donald Paul Smith (FatherTime369v) Founder of SDKP | Inventor of SharonCare1
